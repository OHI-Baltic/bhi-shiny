The Dashboard is a data exploration tool, for visualizing the results as well as input data for the assessment. The Baltic Health Index is a regional study under the global Ocean Health Index framework. The aim is to maintain and continually improve a tool that can be used by decision-makers to guide management of the Baltic Sea region towards increased sustainability. Oceans in general provide a diverse array of benefits to humans, often with tradeoffs between benefits. Managing these requires a method of measurement that is both comprehensive and quantitative; establishing such a method was the motivation behind the Ocean Health Index. We strive to use the best open source tools available, to make our ocean health metrics,  results and underlying data easily accessible and entirely transparent


### `BHI 2.0` 

As of January of 2019, we began working on our second Baltic Health Index assessment! We will be building on the earlier goal models, making improvements where possible, and including new datasets where relevant. We hope also to be able to conduct scenario testing and sensitivity analysis, create features for interactive data exploration/presentation, and assess interconnectivity of goals.

### The Ocean Health Index framework

Oceans in general provide a diverse array of benefits to humans. Managing for such a broad range of benefits requires a method of measurement that is both comprehensive and quantitative. Establishing such a method was the motivation behind the [development of the Ocean Health Index](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11397). 

Trade-offs and linkages between the different benefits, a sparsity of data about the detailed goings-on in the oceans' depths, and conflicting views on what constitutes responsible resource use makes sustainable management a big task, especially when optimal management requires assessments to be made regularly so trends can be identified and effectiveness of management strategies can be analyzed. Borrowing tools and workflows  application development and business analytics, we aim to make our work not only reproducible and transparent, but more time-efficient with each iteration (read more about this: [Better Science in Less Time](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)).
