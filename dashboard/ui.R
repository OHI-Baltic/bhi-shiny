Central and eastern Baltic Sea is generally characterized by intermediate scores with the biological components often being above the target values of individual components. The lowest scoring across all subbasins was recorded for marine mammals, with the lowest values in the Bornholm and Western Gotland basins (10) and only achieving the target level in Kattegat.
