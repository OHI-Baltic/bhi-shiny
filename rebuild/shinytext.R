  ## key information
  "This goal has three sub-components: stock, access, and need. For the BHI, the focus is on the coastal fish stock sub-component and will use this as a proxy for the entire goal. For this, we used two HELCOM core indicators: (1) abundance of coastal fish key functional groups (Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) of cyprinids/mesopredators and CPUE of piscivores); (2) abundance of key coastal fish species (CPUE of perch, cod or flounder, depending on the area).",
  ## target
  "Target values for the status assessments are identified based on site-specific time-series data for each indicator (same as in HELCOM HOLAS II), as coastal fish generally have local population structures, limited migration, and show local responses to environmental change.",
  ## key messages
  "The target is reached in Kattegat (Danish coast), Bornholm Basin (Swedish coast), Eastern Gotland basin (Lithuanian coast), Northern Baltic Proper (Finnish coast), Bothnian Sea (Swedish coast), The Quark (Finnish coast) and Bothnian Bay. The more northern areas, where perch is used as the key species and is more abundant, are in better status compared to more southern areas, where flounder is used as the key species, but in now in lower abudance with respect to the target. Similarly, the status of piscivores is better in more northern areas, whereas the status of cyprinids in more north-eastern areas of the Baltic Sea is not good as a result of too high abundance. In particular, the status scores are low in the Gulf of Riga (Estonian coast), Bay of Mecklenburg (Danish coast), Great Belt, The Sound (Danish coast) and Arkona Basin (Danish coast), due to low abundance of key species and piscivores, and also due to increasing abundance for cyprinids in some coastal areas.",

  "**Missing country data:** Missing data for Germany, Poland and Russia (and only key species data for Denmark) which is why there is no scoring for their respective basins. \n **Multiple facets of opportunity:** Including ‘need’ and ‘access’ sub-components of this goal alongside the condition of coastal fisheries will give a more complete overview of artisanal fishing opportunity. \n **Sparce Data in some areas:** In some basins there is very few monitoring stations and scaling up from monitoring station to subbasin does likely not provide a fully representative assessment.",

  ## key messages
  "Present-day concentrations of the three pollutants/pollutant groups included in the subgoal generally fall below their relative thresholds, particularly concentrations measured in biota (i.e., fish). The concentrations found in sediments (top 5cm) more often exceed their respective thresholds, reflecting the higher historic concentrations of the contaminants in the Baltic Sea mirrored in subsurface sediment. However, there are many persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic Substances of Very High Concern which are not  monitored across all regions of the Baltic Sea, which lowers the score. The level to which compounds known to be hazardous are monitored in the Baltic Sea is included as an indicator to illustrate that a proper assessment cannot be done due to lack of knowledge on occurrence of pollutants in the Baltic Sea.",
 ## data considerations
 ## note: each bullet point is separated by \n and each bullet heading is framed in double asterisks
 "**Substances of Very High Concern:** The proportion of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic Substances of Very High Concern monitored in the Baltic Sea is used as one of the indicators to highlight the general lack of knowledge on occurrence of emerging contaminants in the Baltic Sea. This indicator and how it is used to calculate the score can be developed further to better combine the two aspects of the contaminant goal: current health of the Baltic Sea, and lack of data. \n **Spatial variability:** Some of the assessment regions have many more data points upon which to base the calculation. As a result, the statistical uncertainty of the scores differs substantially across regions. Generally, there is less data on pollutants/pollutant groups from the southeast near the Baltic states and Poland and Russia. \n **Thresholds:** The threshold values that are used to compare environmental concentrations are crucial for the assessment. Existing threshold values are generated in different ways and have different sources and thus there might be some uncertainty.",

  "Five indicators are combined in the eutrophication subgoal: offshore Secchi depth, summer chlorophyll-a concentration, oxygen debt and winter concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and nitrogen (DIN). Decreased secchi depth (i.e., increased turbidity) and increased chl-a concentration in the summer are indicators of eutrophication related increase in primary production. Oxygen debt, i.e., “missing” oxygen in relation to fully oxygenated water column in water-bodies that are poorly ventilated, results from increased consumption of oxygen in environments where organic material is decomposed. The oxygen debt indicator is calculated using information from salinity and oxygen profiles at the halocline and below in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea (Baltic Proper and Bornholm Basin) following the methodology of HELCOM (2013, 2018). Phosphorus and nitrogen, on the other hand, are the key limiting nutrients of primary production in the Baltic Sea making the winter concentrations of DIP and DIN indicators of the following summer’s production potential. These five eutrophication indicators are also HELCOM core indicators (Baltic Sea Environmental Proceedings No 143).",
  ## target
  "Winter (December-February) nutrient concentrations (dissolved inorganic phosphorus: DIP and dissolved inorganic nitrogen: DIN), summer (June-September) Chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentrations and annually averaged oxygen debt fall below, and summer secchi depth above, the threshold values defined and used by HELCOM (2013, 2018). Thresholds are basin-specific.",
  ## key messages
  "In general, the eutrophication status is better in the North, particularly in the Bay of Bothnia, and in the South close to the Danish Straits. However, the eutrophication management target is only met in waters around Kattegat. Lower status scores were calculated for the Central Baltic Sea, and the eutrophication status score was lowest in the Gulf of Riga (approx. 50).
  \n 
  The Eutrophication trend from the past 10 years indicates positive development in the areas near the Danish Sounds, where also the current status is good, but also in the Archipelago Sea, and Gulfs of Finland and Gdansk. The trend is negative elsewhere in the Baltic Sea. Based on the trend calculations, most negative development in the near future can be expected in the Gulf of Riga, which already has the lowest status score, as well as in the Quark area. That negative trends are observed in the Gulf of Bothnia, where the status score is relatively high, indicates that even in the “lower-concern” areas one needs to monitor closely the development of eutrophication.
  \n 
  For most basins the Secchi depth target is not met at present and secchi depth is lower than the threshold value, Kattegat being the only exception. Also, the future trend is negative in most basins, excluding Kattegat and the Åland Sea.
  \n 
  The chl-a target threshold was exceeded in all basins, with exception of Kattegat. The trend in chl-a was negative for management (i.e., increase in chl-a) in Central Basins of the Baltic Sea, as well as in the Gulf of Finland. Positive development was seen in the Southern parts and Gulf of Riga.
  \n 
  Present-day oxygen debt is above the threshold both in the Baltic Proper and Bornholm Basin, indicating that the management target has not been met.
  \n 
  For DIN, the management target was only met (i.e., lower DIN values) at the entrance to the Baltic Sea. DIN values highest in comparison to the target were found in Gulfs of Riga and Finland. The future trend is weak, but positive (i.e., decreasing DIN) with the exception of most of the northern Baltic Basins. For DIP, the target threshold was clearly exceeded in most of the basins, and met only in the Bothnian Bay and close to the entrance to the Baltic Sea. The future trend for DIP was clearly negative (i.e., increasing DIP) in the North, while slight positive development was identified in the South.
